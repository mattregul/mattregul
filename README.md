I'm a Senior Support Escalation Engineer (Developer helping Developers) at Microsoft and the global SME for [Azure PlayFab](https://playfab.com/) Developer Support.

I specialize in backend systems for live games, cross-platform SDKs, and cloud-integrated services. I’m also deeply involved in the enablement of GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, and LLM-based tools—helping teams boost productivity and solve real-world problems with AI.

🕸️ **Why My Repos Are Quiet**  
99.9% of what I work on is internal, confidential, or contributed via PRs to other teams/orgs. But I’m always happy to talk shop, share insights, or collaborate on cool ideas.
